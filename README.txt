Hello there. This is a solution to Raccoon 2019 Project/Automation selection process. 

In folder bin you can find 2 bash scripts that uses jq, so you'll need it to run them.
Jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor (you can find it here https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

script.sh solves exercise a,b and c.

script2.sh solves exercise d.
